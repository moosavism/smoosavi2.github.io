I am a Staff Machine Learning Researcher at Apple Zurich. Prior to that, I was an Assistant Professor at <a href="https://imperial.ac.uk/">Imperial College London</a> in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering. Before joining Imperial College, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="https://ml.inf.ethz.ch/">Institute for Machine Learning</a> at the <a href="http://ethz.ch/en.html">ETH Zurich</a>. I received my PhD in Computer and Communication Sciences under the supervision of <a href="https://people.epfl.ch/pascal.frossard">Pascal Frossard</a> at the <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/">École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)</a>, Switzerland in November 2019. My PhD research focused on the analysis of the robustness of classifiers and its connection with the geometry of deep neural networks. I was also fortunate to intern for the Apple AI Research in 2017, working on autonomous technologies.

I got my M.Sc. degree in Communication Systems from the EPFL, in 2014, and my B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from <a href="https://aut.ac.ir/en">Tehran Polytechnic</a>, Iran, in 2012.
